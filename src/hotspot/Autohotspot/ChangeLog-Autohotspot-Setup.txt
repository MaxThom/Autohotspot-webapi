Added indents to the child functions in the Forceswitch function.
In dhcpcd.conf for the static Hostspot setup, moved nohooks below the interface wlan0 line
Now only wlan0 is blocked from using wpa_supplicant.conf. Wlan1 can be used to connect to a network but will
not give hotspot connected devices access to the internet. The pi will have network access through wlan1.
